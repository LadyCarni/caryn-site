              <h2>Instructions</h2>

              <p className="tip">The cookie dough in this recipe needs to chill for at least 4 hours, so prepare accordingly! You can also chill them for up to 72 hours, or you can scoop and freeze them for up to 2 months!</p>

              <p><span className="instruction-step stir-step">Step 1.</span> In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, black pepper, and salt. Set aside.</p>

              <p><span className="instruction-step stir-step">Step 2.</span> In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer, beat together the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides as needed. Add in the vanilla and orange zest and beat until combined. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low. Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add in the molasses and bourbon and beat until combined. Gradually add in the dry ingredients and beat until it's evenly incorporated.</p>

              <p><span className="instruction-step prep-step">Step 3.</span> Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to 3 days.</p>

              <h2>When you're ready to bake</h2>

              <p><span className="instruction-step prep-step">Step 1.</span> Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</p>

              <p><span className="instruction-step prep-step">Step 2.</span> Prepare two of your favorite cookie sheets.</p>

              <p><span className="instruction-step stir-step">Step 3.</span> Roll the dough into 3 Tablespoon sized balls. Fill a small and shallow bowl with granulated sugar. Roll each ball in the sugar until it's completely coated. Place the sugar coated cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2 inches between each ball for spreading.</p>

              <img src={BourbonMolassesPrep} alt="preparing bourbon molasses cookies"/>

              <p><span className="instruction-step cook-step">Step 4.</span> Bake, one tray at a time, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cookies have puffed up and have begun to slightly crack on top. (They will crack more as they cool, so don't over bake!)</p>

              <p><span className="instruction-step prep-step">Step 5.</span> Remove from the oven and place the pan on a cooling rack. Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, then carefully transfer the cookies to a separate cooling rack to cool completely.</p>

              <p><span className='instruction-step serve-step'>Step 6.</span> Serve cookies warm, or completely cool them and store them in an airtight container for up to 4 days.  Cookies may also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>
